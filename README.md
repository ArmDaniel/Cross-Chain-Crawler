# Cross-Chain-Crawler
Cross-chain crawler using Web of Trust and Google NL APIs to rate as many sites and services on various blockchains. The application is built using the Cosmos SDK and IBC Protocol.

By virtue of using the Cosmos SDK, the crawler will be an application where records of every analysis and reputation reports are maintained with a high degree of security and reliability, since these records are public and immutable ( any changes affect all other blocks, but this requires the consensus of the network ). 

The advantage is perhaps one blockchain technology requires: popularisation. Since this analysis will provide secure information and a reliable report on any blockchain and all applications built on it, users will have a higher degree of confidence in using them. The benefit for the Cosmos community is evident as well: people will trust the network and use it more.

This application is registered for the Cross-chain hackathon organized by Cosmos on Gitcoin: https://gitcoin.co/issue/cosmos/ics/408/4212
