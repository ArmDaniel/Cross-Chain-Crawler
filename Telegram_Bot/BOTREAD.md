# Telegram Bot

The Telegram Bot is used in order to popularise the use of blockchain technologies and be employed in any group, spreading the word.

It is very user-friendly and creates a trust chain amongst the community.

### Our spider is hackable

Many automations,such as the ones provided as example, may be coded and thus added as functionalities to the bot.
It grows with you!
